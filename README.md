# grigsby.photos

Just a minimalistic photography gallery website designed to showcase my casual macrophotography and photography. I tried to keep it clean, and I habitually use CMU Serif font so I went ahead and used it here too.

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the gallery.

## Image Organization

- Macrophotography images are stored in the `images/Macrophotography/` directory
- Photography images are stored in the `images/Photography/` directory
